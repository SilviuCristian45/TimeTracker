# TimeTracker

TimeTracker is a script that tracks the time you spent at the PC . These intervals are saved into docs in each day .

How to use it ?

Just dowload the source code and the docs folder in any folder you want . The plan.png is just the algorithm and it's not necessary if you just want to use this tool .
In order to use the tool, it's important to make a shortcut to main.py and place it into the startup apps folder . This will open the tool when you open the PC . 
Tip:To do that , just press Win+Alt+R and type shell:startup and press Enter . This command will open the startup apps folder .

But if you want to understand how i designed the algorithm, maybe you should take a look at plan.png
